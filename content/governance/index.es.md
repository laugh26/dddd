These documents cover guiding principles, purpose, scope of work and operational requirements to ensure we share the same values and always operate in the best interests of the&nbsp;network."

As contributors to the Cadex community we are members of one of the world’s first functioning anarcho-syndicalist societies. This revolutionary system is based on the belief that when people are free to act in their own best interests, they naturally work in the best interests of society as well. Another way to describe anarcho-syndicalism is&nbsp;decentralization.

Decentralized digital currencies like Cadex take control of the monetary system away from government and corporate elites, and returns freedom, privacy and financial power to the individual. That’s why Cadex is not just a payments protocol, it’s actually a vector for a profound change in the way the global economic system operates. Decentralized governance is at its heart. Because there is no central authority for Cadex, a crucial part of our role as members of this community is to be champions of neutrality and consensus based decision&nbsp;making.

titleText="Benefits Of Decentralization"

Decentralization also offers protection from corruption. History has shown us countless times that too much power in too few hands inevitably leads to its abuse. What’s more it gives the individual a chance to make a real difference. Improvements to the protocol come from the bottom up, and can be submitted by anyone. Cadex’s thriving community is living proof that when people are trusted to do good, they will contribute for the good of&nbsp;all.

When everyone in the Cadex community takes responsibility for contributing to the development of the protocol and is actively pushing it’s message out to the world, not only does the community benefit, the benefits spread to society as a whole. Conversely, without your participation as an empowered autonomous individual there can be no decentralization, and hence no Cadex. Cadex’s success truly is up to you, and you are free to make it&nbsp;happen.

Cadex is a community initiative that allows anyone to contribute in a number of different ways. The Cadex ecosystem is more than just open-source development. Content creation, promotion and adoption are equally important as a decentralized digital currency -  that’s why the key to success is contributions from people of different&nbsp;skillsets.
