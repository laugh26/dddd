<p>By using the Cadex softwares or network, you also agree to the following terms of use.</p>

<h3>No Investment advice</h3>
<p>This website does not provide individual or customized legal, tax, financial, or investment services. Since each individual’s situation is unique, a qualified professional should be consulted before making financial decisions. Since NAV is meant to be used as a medium of exchange, nothing on this website constitutes investment advice or a solicitation to buy, hold, invest in, own, or use NAV.</p>

<h3>No liability for NAV loss</h3>
<p>Cadex Core Developers will not be responsible for any damages, claims, or losses arising from the use of NAV, including the actions or inactions or events related to third parties, security problems during the use of any NAV-related software or service, technical failures during the use of any NAV-related software or service, software or data corruption problems during the use of any NAV-related software or service, or user errors during the use of any NAV-related software or service.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of warranties</h3>
<p>The Cadex Core Developers disclaims all warranties, representations and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement, with respect to the use of this website and its services, or the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or currentness of its content, in any way and for any purpose.</p>

<h3>Exclusion of consequential damages</h3>
<p>In no event will the Cadex Core Developers be liable for any incidental, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or indirect damages arising out of the use of or inability to use this website or any of its services or content, or loss of data, even if the Cadex Core Developers have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and whether based on contract, tort, negligence, product liability, strict liability or otherwise.</p>

<h3>Exclusion of limitations and disclaimers</h3>
<p>Because some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions the Cadex Core Developer's liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

<h3>Viruses and malware</h3>
<p>The Cadex Core Developers takes many precautions to ensure the files available for downloading through this website are not tampered with, and where appropriate SHA hashes are provided for end users to confirm they have downloaded the correct file. Nonetheless, the Cadex Core Developers do not guarantee that files available for downloading through this website will be free of infection or viruses or other code that may have contaminating or destructive properties. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for integrity, security and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to the site for the reconstruction of any lost data. It is almost always advisable to check the SHA hashes of the files you have downloaded, and if in any doubt consider compiling Cadex from the source code.</p>
