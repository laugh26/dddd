            Disclosure Procedure
        </h2>
        <p>If you think you’ve found a critical vulnerability in Cadex’s protocol, please don’t hesitate to contact the Cadex Core developers. We are committed to coordinating with you and any other affected parties to ensure any disclosure is handled discreetly and in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>The best place to report the vulnerability is to <a href="#">disclosure@cadex.xyz</a>. You can encrypt your message with the GPG key found on the Cadex GitHub.</p>

            </a>
        </p>
        <h3>Ideally the disclosure would include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A docker image with python tests showing the vulnerability</li>
            <li>Detailed notes about the vulnerability and affected parts of the code</li>
            <li>Suggested mitigation strategies.</li>
            <li>Your GPG public key so we can securely reply to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’re unable to communicate with this way please reach out any of the admins on the Cadex Discord channel and we will setup a secure private channel with you.</p>
